  <Description>This mod changes the emissive colors of all blocks to allow people with Red / Green Color Vision Deficiencies to better differentiate between them.

Features
- Green was changed to have more blue, resulting in a teal-adjacent color.
- Yellow status indicators were changed to orange.
- Orange status indicators were chagned to yellow.

Notes
- This was made specifically for w4stedspace and his particular CVD but I felt it might be beneficial for other people as well.
