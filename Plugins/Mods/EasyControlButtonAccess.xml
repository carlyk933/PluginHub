  <Description>Ever find yourself in a combat situation and scrambling in the terminal to take control of either a Remote Control or Turret? The goal of this mod is to make that scramble a little less stressful. This mod takes the Control button for the Remote Control and Turret blocks and moves it to the top of the terminal. No more scrolling!

This mod may have been inspired by my own frustrations with the vanilla button placement</Description>
