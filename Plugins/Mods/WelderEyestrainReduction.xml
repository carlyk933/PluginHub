  <Description>This mod reduces the intense flickering of the light produced by the welding tool.
The brightness and other effects remain the same, but the strobe-like flashing has been toned down significantly.

You don't need to be extra photosensitive to feel discomfort from welding for any period of time. Even Xocliw has expressed this to be annoyance over six years ago - and it's still a problem!
