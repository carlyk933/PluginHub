  <Tooltip>This is for those people who like hearing battle sounds loud while not being deafened by their grinder, welder and most of all drill.</Tooltip>
  <Description>This mod reduces the volume of hand tools, ship tools, weather, doors, placement sounds and a few others that often feel deafening, while leaving the explosions booming, gatlings cracking and letting you hear a little bit more of the atmospheric sounds (though not the deafening rain).
For everyone who loves a good action movie, but doesn't feel that mining is action, this one's for you!
