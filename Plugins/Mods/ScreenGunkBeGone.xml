  <Tooltip>This mod reduces screen gunk by toning down most of the post-processing effects.</Tooltip>
  <Description>Since Keen does not like giving us graphical options, I decided to make a mod to remove the crap that is smeared all over the screen. I have also reduced vignette and the chromatic abomination aberration. I think that the bloom looks real neat on the tracers, so I've kept it (but had to tone it down b/c it was blinding after removing the dirt).

Enjoy being able to see a bit better!</Description>
