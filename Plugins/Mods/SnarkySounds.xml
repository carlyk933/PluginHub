  <Description>This mod is for people who are tired of the default suit voice, and perhaps life also...

Please be aware, this suit AI does NOT care for your well being - quite the opposite. While still providing all HUD voice notifications (and with FAR more variants) this mod is more about reminding you that you should already be paying attention ;)

I'd intended this for April Fools, but hey... I'm sure in some multiverse someplace it's still on time.

The video is a demo of a few lines only, there are MANY more.

Replaces the following Suit and Game Audio notifications:

- All Suit and Ship Power Notifications
- Hydrogen Notifications
- Health Notifications
- Handbrake and Antenna Notifications
- Inventory Notifications
- More planned...

There are MANY variations (91 currently) ;)

This mod was made live on Twitch with the help of the wonderful SE community, you can join us here: https://www.twitch.tv/w4stedspace</Description>
