  <Description>View a cutaway of projected ships with this mod! Supposedly great for hand building ships layer by layer.

You can select the axis of the cutaway plane, starting layer, and layers to show from the starting layer.

The blocks are only hidden visually, they can still be built even if the projected block is hidden</Description>
