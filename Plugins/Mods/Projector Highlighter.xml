  <Tooltip>Projector Highlighter adds color-coded wireframe around projected blocks showing their state for clearer visual feedback</Tooltip>
  <Description>Ever had trouble finding that one projected block that didn't get placed? I introduce to you the Projector Highlighter!

Projected blocks that can be built have a green wireframe around their block space, while incorrect blocks will have a red outline (without "Show Only Buildable" selected), both of which are visible through other blocks.

Yellow blocks are damaged or incomplete blocks connected to parts of the projection.

For simplicity, this runs only on clients and they bear the brunt of a slightly inefficient grid check. Only grids within 250m are checked every minute to see if they have any projectors.

Cycle the highlights by entering /highlight in chat

Expect it to take up to a minute when placing a new projector to see any effect.
Once it's picked up on a projector updates occur every second.</Description>
