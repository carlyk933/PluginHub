  <Tooltip>Persistent PCU display on your HUD.</Tooltip>
  <Description>Toggleable, always on screen readout of your current ships PCU, including connected grids. 
    Created for use on servers that utilize the 'Top Grid' mechanic to help you keep your pcu in check.
    
    Toggle the display on/off using 'Ctrl + NumPad0' while sitting in a ship. The display will continue to show that ships PCU, along with anything that it is connected to until you disable the display.
    You can change the position of the display by holding down 'Shift + Alt + Mouse Right Click' and moving the mouse.
    
    Upon first activation a dialog will let you input a value to use as the upper limit, all this does designate when to change the color of the display from green to red.
    Settings are saved in your %AppData%/SpaceEngineers/Storage/PCUDisplay folder, where you can also change the keybind (default NumPad0).
    
    Note: If you merge a ship that you are currently displaying PCU for, the counter will not update until you disable and re-enable it.
