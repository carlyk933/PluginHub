  <Description>Utility plugin for Space Engineers, allowing direct debugging of Programmable Block scripts via Space Engineers. Designed for MDK projects.

This plugin owes its existence to Inflex, who created the first version of it. By his permission I have rewritten and adapted it for use with MDK projects, but his basic methodology survives.

This plugin is currently a prototype. It should work but it's technically not in a "releasable" state yet and I haven't really decided how much I should truly integrate it with MDK. Most likely the assembly selection method will remain for people who don't want to use MDK, and we'll see if I integrate it more completely with MDK.</Description>
